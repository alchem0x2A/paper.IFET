* Introduction

Recent advances in semiconductor materials and physics have driven the
development of field-effect transistors (FETs) for a variety of
applications  cite:Torsi_2013_rev,Ben_Sasson_2014.

Enabling mechanical durability and responsiveness in FETs offers new
 technological opportunities beyond the reach of existing platforms.

Typical strategy for creating mechanically responsive FETs relies on
 coupling of another passive component, which often limits sensitivity
 and increases power consumption.

It is desirable to intrinsically incorporate the durability in

For example, the elasticity, the ability of a material to return to
its original shape when the deforming stress is released, requires an
entropic force acting within the material, fundamentally impeding
carrier transport cite:OConnor_2011_strain_P3HT.  Here we demonstrate
a conceptually different approach concept to to address the challenge,
inspired by the liquid-repellent behavior of a sessile droplet
interacting with a superhydrophobic surface. We design an interfacial
transistor made by superhydrophobic semiconductor nanowires (NWs)
sandwiched between a layer of two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) and
a conductive Cassie-Baxter (CB) sessile droplet. Following the
reversible motion of the CB droplet upon mechanical stress, we report
a large vertical elastic displacement up to 12.5% together with an
excellent stress sensitivity down to 1 pascal. Our analysis shows that
the stress-current response is mainly contributed by the reversible
change of contact area at the superhydrophobic liquid-NW
interface. The carrier density in NWs is modulated by the partial
penetration of an electrostatic field through 2DEG, showing an on/off
current ratio exceeding $3 \time 10^{4}$. The interfacial current
density can be further modulated by varing the temperature, due to the
existence of gate-tunable Schottkey barrier at the liquid-NW
interface, adding further controllability in addition to elastic
stress and gate voltage. Here we refer to such device architecture as the
"elastic interfacial transistor", which demonstrates a versatile
platform that bridges multiple macroscopic interfacial phenomena with
nanoelectronic responses


Figure [[ref:fig:main-1]] presents the device architecture of the proposed
interfacial transistor. We consider a quantum capacitor device
cite:Luryi_1988, in which a semiconductor layer is sandwiched between
a conductive drain (D) and a 2DEG source (S) electrodes. The ultrathin
and low-quantum-capacitance (low $C_{\mathrm{Q}}$) nature of 2DEG
allows partial penetration of an electrostatic field exerted by the
underlying gate (G) electrode cite:Shih2015Partially,Tian_2016,
modulating the carrier density in semiconductor that controls
drain-to-source current (\(I_{\mathrm{DS}}\)) (Figure
[[ref:fig:main-1]](a)).
*************** TODO change 
*************** END

The fact that $I_{\mathrm{DS}}$ passes through two
semiconductor-electrode (semicondutor-S and semiconductor-D)
interfaces maximizes the response to the interfacial properties. In
addition, the design allows a thin semiconductor layer with the
thickness smaller than the Debye screening length (due to the low
relative permittivity $\epsilon_{\mathrm{r}}$ and charge density of
semiconductor), offering a high current responsiveness.


Next, we sought to grow semiconductor NWs directly on the 2DEG,
forming a superhydrophobic surface at the Cassie-Baxter (CB) state
cite:Cassie_1944. A conductive sessile droplet is then placed on top
of the NWs, acting as the D electrode, with the radius
$R$. Accordingly, applying a compressive pressure $\Delta p$ on top of
the sessile leads to an horizontal elastic displacement $\Delta x$
that advances the contact line, with an apparent contact angle
$\theta_{\mathrm{adv}}^{*}$ (Figure [[ref:fig:main-1]](b) left). When the
pressure is released, the contact line moves back towards its
equilibrium shape, with an apparent contact angel of
$\theta_{\mathrm{rec}}^{*}$ (Figure [[ref:fig:main-1]](b) right), enabling
the reversibility. We hypothesized that the electrical response during
the process results from: (i) an increase of the droplet contact area
$\Delta A \approx 2 \pi R \Delta x$ at the macroscopic level and (ii)
an increase of capillary length $\Delta l \approx \Delta p
r^{2}/2\gamma$ that effectively reduces the semiconductor channel
length in the NWs, where $\gamma$ is the surface tension of liquid and
$r$ is the average radius between NWs.

*************** TODO Modify Figure 1
*************** END
In order to realize the concept, monolayer graphene (Gr), a 2DEG material
with the smallest quantum capacitance near the Dirac point
cite:Tian_2016, is used. As for the semiconductor material, it is
well-known that the covalently bonded semiconductors generally possess
a high surface energy, since the bandgap is proportional to the bond
strength that separates the highest-occupied and lowest-unoccupied
molecular orbitals cite:Azimi_2013_wetting_RO, and dangling bonds
exists at the surface cite:Zhang_2004_dangling, both presumably
leading to the Wenzel state. To this end, the organic semiconductor
solids containing the \(\pi\)-conjugated molecules, with the molecular
polarizability considerably reduced by perfluoration, were
considered. We have managed to grow the Copper(II)
hexadecafluorophthalocyanine (F_{16}CuPc) NWs on a sheet of monolayer
graphene transferred on a SiO2/Si substrate (details see Supplementary
materials), as shown in Figure [[ref:fig:main-2]](a). 

The F16CuPc NWs have high aspect ratios, with diameters and heights of
~ 30-60 and several hundred nanometers, respectively. We note that the
NW morphology is similar to that of F_{16}CuPc templated by
perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic- 3,4,9,10-dianhydride (PTCDA)
cite:Yang_2009_F16_PTCDA or gold nanoparticles
cite:Mbenkum_2006_F16_1D, presumably sharing the same growth
mechanism. Indeed, the strong $\pi-\pi$ interactions between graphene
and F16CuPc basal planes lower the critical free energy of
heterogeneous nucleation; in combination with the weak van der Waals
(vdW) interactions between the perfluorinated molecular edges that
limit the lateral growth, it explains why the NW structure is
thermodynamically favored. The structural driving force resulting from
the subtle asymmetry between in-plane and out-of-plane interactions,
however, disappears when the substrate-molecule interactions are not
sufficiently strong cite:Tian_2017, as observed in the thin-film
structure grown on bare SiO2/Si (Figure [[ref:fig:main-2]](a)). 

Figure [[ref:fig:main-2]](b) shows the grazing incidence X-ray diffraction
(GIXD) patterns for the F_{16}CuPc/Gr and F_{16}CuPc/SiO_{2}/Si
samples. The F16CuPc/SiO2/Si sample has an intense peak along the
$q_{\mathrm{z}}$ axis, labeled as $\alpha$ (/d/-spacing = 1.470
nm). It corresponds to the (002) plane in the F16CuPc single crystal
cite:Yang_2009_F16_PTCDA that is perpendicular to the substrate normal
vector, suggesting a dominant “edge-on” orientation
(Fig. [[ref:fig:main-2]](b) top). It is also endorsed by the position of
the (\(\bar{1}22\)) plane peak near the $q_{\mathrm{xy}}$ axis
(\(\beta\)) cite:Pandey_2012_F16CuPc_GO,Yoon_2010_crystal_F16, with a
/d/-spacing of 0.305 nm. On the other hand, for the F_{16}CuPc/Gr NW
sample, we observe additional peaks corresponding to the (002) plane
(labelled as $\gamma$) (Figure [[ref:fig:main-2]](b) bottom), with its
wave vector rotated by $\sim 76^{\circ}$ with respect to the
$q_{\mathrm{z}}$ axis, with a /d/-spacing of 1.440 nm, slightly
smaller than that in the edge-on orientation. Together with the
(\(\bar{1}22\)) peak located at the $q_{\mathrm{z}}$ axis, we point
out the emergence of the “face-on” phase in the NWs. The predominant
face-on orientation in the n-type NWs facilitates electron transport
perpendicular to the substrate, through the intermolecular $\pi-\pi$
interactions. The substrate-induced orientation transition also
results in the angle-dependent scattering of the Davydov multiplets
that alters the Raman characteristics (details see Supplementary
information ). Figure [[ref:fig:main-2]](c) presents both the scanning
electron micrograph (SEM) and Raman map for the intensity ratio of the
peak at 1380 cm^{-1} to that at 1315 cm^{-1}, I(1380)/I(1315), on the
F16CuPc film deposited on a sheet of SiO2-supported graphene with a
break. The NW region, with a higher I(1380)/I(1315) ratio, is clearly
identified.

It is straightforward to assume the existence superhydrophobicity at
the NW-liquid interface, as enabled by both the fluorine-rich nature
of F_{16}CuPc, and the Cassie-Baxter wetting phenomenon on the high
aspect-ratio NWs. We validate our hypothesis by examining the water
wettability on the F_{16}CuPc/Gr and F_{16}CuPc/SiO_{2} surfaces
(Figure [[ref:fig:main-2]](d)), using both sessile droplet and
environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) techniques. The
thin-film F_{16}CuPc surface is found to be hydrophobic with a
equilibrium sessile droplet contact angle of $103.0 \pm 5.4 ^{\circ}$
and ESEM contact angle of $107.0 \pm 3.9 ^{\circ}$, as normally
observed for such non-structured fluorine-rich molecules. On the other
hand, the F_{16}CuPc/Gr NWs surface shows much higher equilibirum
sessile and ESEM contact angles of $152.8 \pm 3.9 ^{\circ}$ and $149.8
\pm 3.4 ^{\circ}$, respectively. The great distinction between the
wettability can be briefly explained by the different between the
Wenzel wetting mode on rough planar surface (F_{16}CuPc/SiO_{2}) and
the Cassie-Baxter wetting mode on high aspect ratio surface
(F_{16}CuPc/Gr). The equilibrium contact angles of the two wetting
modes ($\theta^{*}_{\mathrm{W}}$ and $\theta^{*}_{\mathrm{CB}}$) are
given by cite:Cassie_1944,Wenzel_1936:

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:2}
&\cos \theta^{*}_{\mathrm{W}} =& r_{\mathrm{W}} \cos \theta_{\mathrm{Y}} \\
&\cos \theta^{*}_{\mathrm{CB}} =& r_{\mathrm{CB}} f \cos \theta_{\mathrm{Y}} + f - 1
\end{eqnarray}

 where $r_{\mathrm{W}}$ and $\theta_{\mathrm{CB}}$ are the surface
 roughness in both modes, $\theta_{\mathrm{Y}}$ is the hypothetical
 contact angle on an ideally smooth surface form the Young's equation
 and $f$ is the solid fraction in the Cassie-Baxter model. We assume
 that $r_{\mathrm{W}} \approx r_{\mathrm{CB}}$ due to the
 intrinsically identical chemical nature of the two surfaces. By
 plugging in the contact angles on F_{16}CuPc/SiO_{2} and
 F_{16}CuPc/Gr surfaces, we get that $f=0.093$, which indicates a
 minor liquid-semiconductor contact at the interface. By studying the
 dynamic contact angle on F_{16}CuPc with various thickness, we
 confirm the existence of both modes in the two distinct morphologies
 (details see Supporting Information).
*************** TODO Add more details
*************** END
 The high equilibrium ESEM contact of the F_{16}CuPc/Gr surface
 indicates that condensation is unfavorable between the fluorine-rich
 walls of NWs, which is not always achieved on normal nanostructures
 cite:Sharma_2017.
 
 We next examine the wettability of liquid metals (LM) on the
 F_{16}CuPc NWs. It is noteworthy that the key challenge hindering the
 development of LM-based devices is the undesirable adhesion of LM to
 the device surface, in particular about the eutectic gallium indium
 (EGaIn), in which the formation of gallium oxide layer effectively
 reduces the interfacial tension
 cite:Dickey_2008,Doudrick_2014_oxide. Indeed, mercury sessile
 droplets sitting on F_{16}CuPc/Gr NW and F_{16}CuPc/SiO_{2} surfaces
 shows static contact angles of $147.7 \pm 2.5 ^{\circ}$ and $157.1
 \pm 3.8 ^{\circ}$, respectively ([[ref:fig:main-2]] XXX).

*************** TODO Which figure??
*************** END
 The increase of contact angle is caused by a smaller solid fraction
 of NWs compared with F_{16}CuPc/SiO2 surfaces, since CB mode is
 expected to be seen on both surfaces at such large contact
 angle. More interesting, we found that the NWs can effectively reduce
 the adhesion of EGaIn. We performed the attach-detach cycle test
 cite:Ilyas_2017_EGaIn_review,Jiang_2017_EGaIn_adhesion using a EGaIn
 droplet suspended on a glass microcapillary onto these surfaces. The
 EGaIn droplet adheres onto the F_{16}CuPc/SiO_{2} surface and
 separates from the microcapillary up detaching, while on the NW
 surface neglible adhesion is observed, with the EGaIn droplet
 constantly sticking to the capillary (Figure [[ref:fig:main-2]] XXX). The
 distinguished adhesion properties are also revealed via the sliding
 angle $\theta_{\mathrm{sl}}^{*}$ (equivalent to the contact angle
 hysteresis on the surface) of EGaIn. The F_{16}CuPc/SiO_{2} surface
 has a relatively large $\theta_{\mathrm{sl}}^{*}$ of $56.1 \pm 13.2
 ^{\circ}$, while the NW surface exhibits a much smaller
 $\theta_{\mathrm{sl}}^{*}$ $14.6 \pm 2.6 ^{\circ}$. The superior
 wetting properties of LM on the superhydrophobic NW surfaces
 indicates that the our concept of interfacial transistor is feasible
 through actuation of LM droplets on superhydrophobic semiconducting
 NWs.

 Figure [[ref:fig:main-3]](a) presents the schematic of the proposed
 elastic interfacial transistor. A sheet of monolayer graphene grown
 by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was transferred onto a 300 nm
 SiO2/Si substrate functionalized by octadecyltrichrolosilane
 self-assembled monolayer (OTS SAM) cite:Yan_2011, in order to
 minimize the substrate-induced traps cite:Chen_2012 (Figs. SXXX).

  Subsequently, a layer of ~300 nm-high F16CuPc NWs were deposited on

  Information).
*************** TODO Add a scheme in SI
*************** END
  The current density $J_{\mathrm{DS}}$ from the LM (D) to graphene
  (S) in the interfacial transistor was then quantified by normalizing
  the drain current by the contact area of the sessile droplet with
  the NW layer, as a function of drain and gate voltages
  ($V_{\mathrm{D}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{G}}$, respectively). Note that
  since the NWs are only partially wetted, the actual current density
  passing through individual NWs is estimated to be
  $J_{\mathrm{DS}}/f$. Accordingly, the carrier density in F_{16}CuPc
  molecules adjacent to the NW/graphene interface can be modulated by
  the partially penetrated field effect through monolayer graphene
  cite:Tian_2016,Shih2015Partially, tuning the Schottcky barrier
  height at the interface cite:Yang2012Barristor. Note that the
  orientation of F_{16}CuPc molecules on graphene plays an important
  role in the performance of the interfacial transistor: the face-on
  orientation not only faciliates carrier transport along the NW, but
  also makes the intrinsic Fermi level of F_{16}CuPc matching that of
  graphene cite:Mao_2010_F16_level_orien,Ren_2011_F16Gr_Elevel, which
  is crucial for a vertical FET (details see Supporting
  Information). The transfer curve for a representative interfacial
  transistor at $V_{\mathrm{D}}$ = 1 V demonstrates an on/off current
  ratio of $3.9 \time 10^{4}$ (Figure [[ref:fig:main-3]](b)), in line with
  the state-of-the-art vertical field-effect transistor (VFET)
  technology
  cite:Yang2012Barristor,Shih2015Partially,Sun_2017_COF_VFET,Ben_Sasson_2011. Clearly,
  the fact that the present interfacial transistor is well-functional
  at a low VD reflects it potential towards the low-power electronics
  design, which remains challenging for most resistive force-sensing
  components.
*************** TODO Refs to find!
*************** END

  A number of interfacial transistor samples were characterized,
  showing an average on/off current ratio of $5 \times 10^{3}$ (Figure
  [[ref:fig:main-3]](b) inset). The transfer curves at different
  $V_{\mathrm{D}}$ are shown in Figure [[ref:fig:main-3]](c). The on/off
  current ratio gradually decreases with $V_{\mathrm{D}}$, owing to a
  mechanism analogous to the drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL)
  effect in the short-channel FETs
  cite:Packan_1999,Lundstrom_2003. More discussions about the
  transport mechanisms, together with the band diagrams, are stated in
  Supplementary information. We further demonstrate an application
  concerning the gate-tunability of the F_{16}CuPc/Gr interfacial
  transistor, by switching an commercial green LED (Figure
  [[ref:fig:main-3]](d)). The interfacial transistor is connected to a
  home-made bipolar junction transistor (BJT) amplifier circuit, where
  the ratio between current through the interfacial transistor and
  through the LED is ~ 100 times.  We demonstrate that over 10 cycles
  of on-off switching cycles by tuning the $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ from -75 V
  to 100 V, the total current through the circuit can be tuned by 250
  folds with appreciable stability, showing good and reliable gate
  tunability.
  
  The elasticity of liquid enables response to pressure stimuli at the
  NW/LM interface, with relatively large displacement compared with
  conventional piezoelectric devices. The principle behind the elastic pressure sensing using
  droplets is the curvature-induced pressure described by the
  Young-Laplace equation:

  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
	p = \gamma_{\mathrm{L}} (R_{1}^{-1} + R_{2}^{-1})
  \end{equation}

  where $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are the principle radii of the LM droplet,
  and $\gamma_{\mathrm{L}}$ is the surface tension of the liquid. In
  the setup of the interfacial transistor, the LM droplet is placed
  between a conducting cantilever and the NW surface. When no external
  pressure is applied, the height of a droplet $H_{0}$ is determined
  by volume $V_{\mathrm{drop}}$, contact angles with the cantilever
  $\theta_{\mathrm{t}}$ and NW $\theta_{\mathrm{b}}$. A vertical
  stress of the droplet $\sigma = \Delta H / H_{0}$, where $\Delta H$
  is the change of droplet height corresponds to an external stress of
  $\Delta p(\sigma) = p(H_{0} - \Delta H) - p(H_{0})$. Since the
  gravitational effect can be ignored in the LM droplets (Bond number
  much less than 1), the boundaries of the droplet is spherical and an
  analytical model is used to solve the principle radii $R_{1}$ and
  $R_{2}$ using $V_{\mathrm{drop}}$, $H$, $\theta_{\mathrm{t}}$ and
  $\theta_{\mathrm{b}}$ as input parameters (details see Supporting
  Information). The stress induced by the strain of droplet is then
  calculated by Eq. [[ref:eq:1]]. Figure [[ref:fig:main-4]](b) shows the cross
  sectional images of a LM droplet under different strains and the
  corresponding stress calculated by the analytical model. To validate
  our analytical model, we further perform a finite element method
  (FEM) analysis to calculate the spatial distribution of surface
  stress on the LM droplet, with the boundary shape of the droplet
  extracted from optical images. The $\Delta p$ values calculated by
  both models are close, indicating the possibility of using the
  analytical model to calculate the elastic stress. The stress-strain
  response of a LM droplet is shown in Figure [[ref:fig:main-4]](c). A
  strain of 12.5% corresponds to a stress of ~125 Pa.

  The drain-source current $I_{\mathrm{DS}}$ also upon pressing the
  droplet, with an amplification of over 5 times under 12.5%
  strain. The sensing at such low pressure range while maintaining a
  relative large displacement behaves among the most sensitive
  approaches.
*************** TODO Examples?
*************** END


  As we hypothesized in the introduction part, two mechanism may be
  responsible for the current increase upon elastic stimuli, i.e. the
  change of LM/NW contact area, and increase of LM capillary
  length. When the LM droplets are operated under the CB mode, with a
  $\Delta p$ of ~ 100 Pa and average spacing between the NWs of ~ 50
  nm, the change of capillary length is negligible. Indeed the
  $I_{\mathrm{DS}}$ amplification ratio predicted from our theoretical
  model is close to the experimental values, indicating that the
  change of contact area is the main cause of the current response. We
  ascribe the discrepancy between the experimental data and our model
  to the possible penetration of LM into microscale defects on the
  graphene sheet, where wetting state at the NW/LM interface turns
  from CB state to Wenzel state, which is known to occur at a pressure
  > 250 Pa on a superhydrophobic surface cite:Lafuma_2003. The
  pressure response can be further coupled with the gate control of
  $I_{\mathrm{DS}}$, as shown in Figure [[ref:fig:main-4]](d). The curves
  are nearly linear proportional to each other under pressure stimuli,
  indicating that the pressure sensing does not interfere with the
  gate control, and can serve as an additional dimension of control
  for the interface transistor. Finally, we examine the reversibility
  of the pressure sensing using elastic LM droplets. We monitored the
  change of the drain-source current as a function of time during more
  than 10 cycles of pressing-releasing of the LM droplet (Figure
  [[ref:fig:main-4]](e)). At average pressure change of $204.2 \pm 12.3$
  Pa, the current can be tuned over 12 to 14 folds. Moreover the low
  pressure current $I_{0}$ is maintained closed to the initial value ,
  indicating the superhydrophobic-enabled elastic pressure sensing is
  reversible.

  The Schottkey transport barrier at the NW/Gr interface also
  incorporates thermal response into the interfacial transistor. Since
  the gate-tunable current modulation is related to the Schottky
  barrier height $\Phi_{\mathrm{SB}}$, the current density flowing
  through the interface can be described by the thermionic emission
  equation cite:Sze2006Mosfets:

  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:4}
  J_{\mathrm{DS}} = A^{**} T^{2} \exp(- \frac{e \Phi_{\mathrm{SB}}}{kT}) 
		  \left[ \exp(\frac{e V_{\mathrm{D}}}{kT}) - 1\right]
  \end{equation}
  where $T$ is the temperature, $A^{**}$ is the reduced effective
  Richardson constant, $e$ is the unit charge and $k$ is the Boltzmann
  constant. At same $V_{\mathrm{D}}$ and $\Phi_{\mathrm{SB}}$, the
  $J_{\mathrm{DS}}$ is solely controlled by $T$. Within the reverse
  bias regime, where Schottky barrier dominates the current, the
  higher $\Phi_{\mathrm{SB}}$ is, the greater $J_{\mathrm{DS}}$ can be
  tuned by temperature ([[ref:fig:main-5]](a)).

*************** TODO No figure here
*************** END

  Note that since the thermal expansion of LM is relatively small (~
  1% total volume change from 20 $^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to 100
  $^{\circ} \mathrm{C}), the thermal induced change of contact area
  and capillary length can be ignored. We tested the gated-tuned
  $J$_{\mathrm{DS}}$ with the temperature ranging from 20 $^{\circ}
  \mathrm{C}$ to 100 $^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, as shown in Figure
  [[ref:fig:main-5]](a). As expected, $J_{\mathrm{DS}}$ increases with the
  rise of temperature, due to the dominance of $T^{2}$ in
  Eq. [[ref:eq:4]]. The current on-off modulation by $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ is
  not affected, confirming that temperature and gate control are
  independent. To further investigate the influence of temperature on
  the current, we measured the gain of current
  $G(T)=J_{\mathrm{DS}}(T)/J_{\mathrm{DS}}(T=20\ ^{\circ} \mathrm{C})$
  at different $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ levels ([[ref:fig:main-5]](c)). We observe
  a higher current gain at more negative $V_{\mathrm{G}}$, indicating
  the increase of Schottkey barrier. To estimate the
  $\Phi_{\mathrm{SB}}$ at each $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ level, we fitted the
  $G(T)$ curves using least square regression by equation [[ref:eq:4]]. The
  fitted $G(T)$ curves show close
  resemblance to the experimental data, proving the therionic emissive
  nature of the temperature-dependent current gain in our interfacial
  transistor. We further plot the extracted $\Phi_{\mathrm{SB}}$
  values as a function of $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ in Figure
  [[ref:fig:main-5]](d). The Schottky barrier height reduces from 0.46 V
  at $V_{\mathrm{G}}=-100$ V to 0.16 V at $V_{\mathrm{G}} = 100$
  V. 
*************** TODO Theoretical values?
*************** END


  The tuning range of Schottky barrier height (0.30 V) is
  consistent with other reports of graphene-based VFETs
  cite:Yang2012Barristor,Dankert_2017_graphene_spin_SB, and is smaller
  than the theoretical value (0.59 V), which is not surprising since
  it is widely known that the Fermi level of graphene can be pinned by
  surface-bound charge traps.


* Conclusions

In this paper, we introduce a new electronic platform -- the
interfacial transistor as an extension to conventional field effect
transistors, by combining multiscale phenomena at different interfaces
to the semiconductor material. As we demonstration example we show the
design and working principle of a graphene-F_{16}CuPc interfacial
transistor. Nanowires of F_{16}CuPc are formed on graphene surface due
to graphene-assisted template effect, giving rise to macroscopic
superhydrophobicity at the NW-liquid interface. The
superhydrophobicity enables versatile operation of droplets on the NW
interface. Owing to the elasticity of liquid droplets, it is feasible
to introduce pressure sensing capability at the semiconductor-liquid
interface, which further enables detection with large displacement. At
the graphene-semiconductor interface, due to the Fermi level match and
field effect transparency, the drain-source current can be tuned over
a large range by gate voltage modulation in a vertical field effect
transistor. Moreover, an additional interface to the semiconductor is
easily introduced involving the thermal carrier emission at the
graphene-semiconductor junction. All the interfaces to semiconductor
can be operated without interference, which facilitates
multi-dimensional operations of the interfacial transistor. Our
concept of interfacial transistors can be extended to a wide variety
of electronic devices, where multiscale phenomena at the
2D-material-semiconductor interfaces are involved. Stimuli responses
involving interfacial physics such as motion of liquid enabled by
superhydrophobic semiconductor nanostructure, light switching due to
optical transparency of 2D materials and charge transfer with
environmental molecules owing to the long Debye length of organic
semiconductors can all be integrated into single interfacial
transistor, which opens a broad future for next-generation versatile,
multifunctional and inexpensive electronics.

# We tested multiple
# interfacial transistor samples and found that the average on-off ratio
# is around $5 \times 10^{3}$ times (inset histogram of Figure
# [[ref:fig:main-3]](b)). The $J_{\mathrm{DS}}$ shows similar shape respect
# to $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ for higher $V_{\mathrm{D}}$ levels, while the
# on-off ratio slightly decreases (Figure [[ref:fig:main-3]](c)), which is a
# ubiquitous feature of 2D material-based VFETs as the field effect
# transparency becomes less at higher drain-source bias
# cite:Tian_2016. At $V_{\mathrm{D}}=5$ V, the F_{16}CuPc NWs can
# sustain current density as large as $9\times10^{2}$ $\mathrm{mA}\cdot
# \mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, which is practical for modulation of power devices
# thanks to the high carrier mobility of F_{16}CuPc. Consider the fact
# that the areas of the NWs in contact with the LM droplet is only a
# small proportion compared with the whole contact area of the
# droplet-semiconductor interface, the actual current density in the NWs
# can be even higher. We also found that the gate-tunability if unipolar
# regarding $V_{\mathrm{D}}$. At positive $V_{\mathrm{D}}$ (reverse
# bias), tuning $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ from -100 V to 100 V can modulate
# $|J_{\mathrm{DS}}|$ over 3 order of magnitudes, while at negative
# $V_{\mathrm{D}}$ (forward bias), changing $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ only
# modulates $|J_{\mathrm{DS}}|$ by a factor of ~5 times (Figure
# [[ref:fig:main-3]](d)). The highly gate-tunable current and unipolar
# response to $V_{\mathrm{D}}$ can be explained by the energy level
# alignment at the graphene-semiconductor interface, as shown in Figure
# [[ref:fig:main-3]](e). The Fermi level of face-on F_{16}CuPc on graphene
# is found around -4.5~-4.7 eV
# cite:Mao_2010_F16_level_orien,Ren_2011_F16Gr_Elevel,Zhong_2012_gr_CuPc,
# matching the Fermi level of graphene (-4.6 eV), and is greatly
# different from that of edge-on F_{16}CuPc
# (cite:Mao_2010_F16_level_orien). As a result, at open circuit, the
# graphene layer is only slightly p-doped (Supporting Information Figure
# S12), which is crucial to the wide range of gate tunability. At
# reverse bias, the drain-source current is dominated by the Schottky
# barrier height (\(\Phi_{\mathrm{SB}}\)) at the graphene-semiconductor
# interface. When $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ is larger than the charge neutral
# point (CNP) voltage ($V_{\mathrm{CNP}}$, when the graphene layer has
# minimal doping), the the Fermi level of graphene shifts down compared
# with its Dirac point, giving rise to an elevated $\Phi_{\mathrm{SB}}$,
# which suppresses the $J_{\mathrm{DS}}$. On the other hand, when
# $V_{\mathrm{G}} < V_{\mathrm{CNP}}$, $\Phi_{\mathrm{SB}}$ is reduced,
# which increases the $J_{\mathrm{DS}}$. At forward bias, the current
# density in the NW is dominated by the semiconductor-LM interface
# cite:Shih2015Partially. Since the work function of mercury (4.5 eV)
# matches with F_{16}CuPc, there is negligible transport barrier at the
# semiconductor-LM interface, resulting in a almost constant
# $I_{\mathrm{DS}}$ regardless of $V_{\mathrm{G}}$. We further
# demonstrate an application concerning the gate-tunability of the
# graphene-F_{16}CuPc interfacial transistor, by switching an commercial
# LED ([[ref:fig:main-3]](f)). Over 10 cycles of on-off switching cycles by
# tuning the $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ from -75 V to 100 V, the total current
# through the circuit $I_{\mathrm{tot}}$ can be tuned by 250 folds with
# appreciable stability.

# The elasticity of liquid enables response to pressure stimuli at the
# NW-LM interface, with relatively large displacement compared with
# conventional piezoelectric devices. We employ this phenomenon in our
# interfacial transistor as an additional interface to external
# stimuli. The principle behind the elastic pressure sensing using
# droplets is the curvature-induced pressure described by the
# Young-Laplace equation:

# \begin{equation}
# \label{eq:3}
# \Delta p = \gamma (R_{1}^{-1} + R_{2}^{-1})
# \end{equation}
# where $\Delta p$ is the stress of droplet at the interface, $R_{1}$
# and $R_{2}$ are the principle radii of a droplet, and $\gamma$ is the
# surface tension of the liquid. The pressure change when deforming a
# droplet on a surface gives rise to the change of $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$
# (Figure [[ref:fig:main-4]](a)). The change in $R_{1}$ causes the expansion
# of contacting are at the semiconductor-LM interface, and change in
# $R_{2}$ enables large displacement. To analyze the degree of droplet
# deformation, we introduce the droplet strain as the ratio between
# vertical displacement and the original height of the droplet $\sigma =
# \Delta H / H_{0}$. The strain can be obtained extracting the change of
# droplet height between the parallel plates in the microscope
# image. The droplet strain can either be calculated from the fitted
# principle radii from experimental images using eq [[ref:eq:3]], or using
# an analytical model which considers the liquid contact angle on both
# plates (see Supporting Information). The values of experimental and
# modeled stress as a function of the droplet strain are close to each
# other (Figure [[ref:fig:main-4]](b), top), with a maximum stress of ~125
# Pa at vertical strain up 12.5%. The stress also leads to an increase
# of source-to-drain current in the interfacial transistor. From the
# schematic drawing in Figure [[ref:fig:main-1]](c), the change of current
# may be due to the increase of contact radius. To verify this
# hypothesis, we calculated the current ratio at certain pressure
# compared with the reference point ($\Delta p=0$), using both the
# experimental value and the simplified model: $I/I_{0} \propto
# (r/r_{0})^{2}$, where $r$ is the contact radius (Figure
# [[ref:fig:main-4]](b), bottom). Both methods show the same trend,
# indicating the stress-responsive current change is mainly due to the
# change of contact radius. We note that the ratio calculated from the
# simplified analytical model is slightly smaller than the experimental
# value, which may be caused by the non-uniform height of the NWs, and
# penetration of LM into the voids between the NWs. We further a finite
# element model (FEM) to calculate the droplet stress due to the
# strain of the LM droplet. We extracted the boundary of the
# droplet from the optical images at different displacements and plug
# into the analytical and FEM models (Figure [[ref:fig:main-4]](c)). The
# pressure values calculated by both models are close, and the maximum
# pressure that can be applied before the mechanical failure of the
# F_{16}CuPc NWs is between 100 - 200 Pa. The detection at such low
# pressure range is already among the most sensitive approaches, while a
# relative large displacement can still be assured, benefited from the
# elasticity of LM droplet and superhydrophobicity of F_{16}CuPc
# NWs. The pressure response can be further coupled with the gate
# control of drain-source current, as shown in Figure
# [[ref:fig:main-4]](d). The $I_{\mathrm{DS}}-V_{\mathrm{G}}$ curves are
# nearly linear proportional to each other under pressure stimuli,
# indicating that the pressure sensing does not interfere with the gate
# control, and can serve as an additional dimension of control for the
# interface transistor. Finally, we examine the reversibility of the
# pressure sensing using elastic LM droplets. We monitored the change of
# the drain-source current $I_{\mathrm{DS}}$ as a function of time $t$
# during more than 10 cycles of pressing-releasing of the LM droplet
# ([[ref:fig:main-4]](d)).  At average pressure change of 204.2 $\pm$ 12.3
# Pa, the current $I_{\mathrm{DS}}$ can be tuned over 12~14
# folds. Moreover the low pressure current is maintained closed to the
# initial value $I_{0}$, indicating the superhydrophobic-enabled elastic
# pressure sensing is reversible.

# We can even add an additional interface to the transistor taking
# advantage of the thermal response of the graphene-semiconductor
# interface.

(a) Multiscale phenomena in the interfacial transistor: at the macroscopic scale, the superhydrophobicity is induced by fluorene-rich semiconducting nanowires; the nanowires (NWs) is led by the unique molecular templating on two dimensional electron gas (2DEG); the energy level alignment at the semiconductor-2DEG interface further enables field effect modulation of interfacial electronic properties. (b) Schematic drawing of an interfacial transistor, composed of (i) liquid metal droplet as drain terminal, from which the elasticity can be induced; (ii) semiconducting nanowires which provide electronic transport and superhydrophobicity; (iii) a 2DEG as source terminal, of which the transport phenomana can be tuned by field effect. (c) Mechanism of the elastic sensing using liquid metal droplet. Droplet strain in the vertical direction causes elastic stress of the droplet. The contact radius of the droplet increases, and in turn changes the current. Superhydrophobicity of the semiconducting NWs enables repeatable droplet shape deformation.
