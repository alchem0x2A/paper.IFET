For example, the elasticity, the ability of a material to return to
its original shape when the deforming stress is released, requires an
entropic force acting within the material, fundamentally impeding
carrier transport cite:OConnor_2011_strain_P3HT.  Here we demonstrate
a conceptually different approach concept to to address the challenge,
inspired by the liquid-repellent behavior of a sessile droplet
interacting with a superhydrophobic surface. We design an interfacial
transistor made by superhydrophobic semiconductor nanowires (NWs)
sandwiched between a layer of two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) and
a conductive Cassie-Baxter (CB) sessile droplet. Following the
reversible motion of the CB droplet upon mechanical stress, we report
a large vertical elastic displacement up to 12.5% together with an
excellent stress sensitivity down to 1 pascal. Our analysis shows that
the stress-current response is mainly contributed by the reversible
change of contact area at the superhydrophobic liquid-NW
interface. The carrier density in NWs is modulated by the partial
penetration of an electrostatic field through 2DEG, showing an on/off
current ratio exceeding $3 \time 10^{4}$. The interfacial current
density can be further modulated by varing the temperature, due to the
existence of gate-tunable Schottkey barrier at the liquid-NW
interface, adding further controllability in addition to elastic
stress and gate voltage. Here we refer to such device architecture as the
"elastic interfacial transistor", which demonstrates a versatile
platform that bridges multiple macroscopic interfacial phenomena with
nanoelectronic responses


Figure [[ref:fig:main-1]] presents the device architecture of the proposed
interfacial transistor. We consider a quantum capacitor device
cite:Luryi_1988, in which a semiconductor layer is sandwiched between
a conductive drain (D) and a 2DEG source (S) electrodes. The ultrathin
and low-quantum-capacitance (low $C_{\mathrm{Q}}$) nature of 2DEG
allows partial penetration of an electrostatic field exerted by the
underlying gate (G) electrode cite:Shih2015Partially,Tian_2016,
modulating the carrier density in semiconductor that controls
drain-to-source current (\(I_{\mathrm{DS}}\)) (Figure
[[ref:fig:main-1]](a)).
*************** TODO change 
*************** END

The fact that $I_{\mathrm{DS}}$ passes through two
semiconductor-electrode (semicondutor-S and semiconductor-D)
interfaces maximizes the response to the interfacial properties. In
addition, the design allows a thin semiconductor layer with the
thickness smaller than the Debye screening length (due to the low
relative permittivity $\epsilon_{\mathrm{r}}$ and charge density of
semiconductor), offering a high current responsiveness.


Next, we sought to grow semiconductor NWs directly on the 2DEG,
forming a superhydrophobic surface at the Cassie-Baxter (CB) state
cite:Cassie_1944. A conductive sessile droplet is then placed on top
of the NWs, acting as the D electrode, with the radius
$R$. Accordingly, applying a compressive pressure $\Delta p$ on top of
the sessile leads to an horizontal elastic displacement $\Delta x$
that advances the contact line, with an apparent contact angle
$\theta_{\mathrm{adv}}^{*}$ (Figure [[ref:fig:main-1]](b) left). When the
pressure is released, the contact line moves back towards its
equilibrium shape, with an apparent contact angel of
$\theta_{\mathrm{rec}}^{*}$ (Figure [[ref:fig:main-1]](b) right), enabling
the reversibility. We hypothesized that the electrical response during
the process results from: (i) an increase of the droplet contact area
$\Delta A \approx 2 \pi R \Delta x$ at the macroscopic level and (ii)
an increase of capillary length $\Delta l \approx \Delta p
r^{2}/2\gamma$ that effectively reduces the semiconductor channel
length in the NWs, where $\gamma$ is the surface tension of liquid and
$r$ is the average radius between NWs.

In order to realize the concept, monolayer graphene (Gr), a 2DEG material
with the smallest quantum capacitance near the Dirac point
cite:Tian_2016, is used. As for the semiconductor material, it is
well-known that the covalently bonded semiconductors generally possess
a high surface energy, since the bandgap is proportional to the bond
strength that separates the highest-occupied and lowest-unoccupied
molecular orbitals cite:Azimi_2013_wetting_RO, and dangling bonds
exists at the surface cite:Zhang_2004_dangling, both presumably
leading to the Wenzel state. To this end, the organic semiconductor
solids containing the \(\pi\)-conjugated molecules, with the molecular
polarizability considerably reduced by perfluoration, were
considered. We have managed to grow the Copper(II)
hexadecafluorophthalocyanine (F_{16}CuPc) NWs on a sheet of monolayer
graphene transferred on a SiO2/Si substrate (details see Supplementary
materials), as shown in Figure [[ref:fig:main-2]](a). 

The F16CuPc NWs have high aspect ratios, with diameters and heights of
~ 30-60 and several hundred nanometers, respectively. We note that the
NW morphology is similar to that of F_{16}CuPc templated by
perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic- 3,4,9,10-dianhydride (PTCDA)
cite:Yang_2009_F16_PTCDA or gold nanoparticles
cite:Mbenkum_2006_F16_1D, presumably sharing the same growth
mechanism. Indeed, the strong $\pi-\pi$ interactions between graphene
and F16CuPc basal planes lower the critical free energy of
heterogeneous nucleation; in combination with the weak van der Waals
(vdW) interactions between the perfluorinated molecular edges that
limit the lateral growth, it explains why the NW structure is
thermodynamically favored. The structural driving force resulting from
the subtle asymmetry between in-plane and out-of-plane interactions,
however, disappears when the substrate-molecule interactions are not
sufficiently strong cite:Tian_2017, as observed in the thin-film
structure grown on bare SiO2/Si (Figure [[ref:fig:main-2]](a)). 

Figure [[ref:fig:main-2]](b) shows the grazing incidence X-ray diffraction
(GIXD) patterns for the F_{16}CuPc/Gr and F_{16}CuPc/SiO_{2}/Si
samples. The F16CuPc/SiO2/Si sample has an intense peak along the
$q_{\mathrm{z}}$ axis, labeled as $\alpha$ (/d/-spacing = 1.470
nm). It corresponds to the (002) plane in the F16CuPc single crystal
cite:Yang_2009_F16_PTCDA that is perpendicular to the substrate normal
vector, suggesting a dominant “edge-on” orientation
(Fig. [[ref:fig:main-2]](b) top). It is also endorsed by the position of
the (\(\bar{1}22\)) plane peak near the $q_{\mathrm{xy}}$ axis
(\(\beta\)) cite:Pandey_2012_F16CuPc_GO,Yoon_2010_crystal_F16, with a
/d/-spacing of 0.305 nm. On the other hand, for the F_{16}CuPc/Gr NW
sample, we observe additional peaks corresponding to the (002) plane
(labelled as $\gamma$) (Figure [[ref:fig:main-2]](b) bottom), with its
wave vector rotated by $\sim 76^{\circ}$ with respect to the
$q_{\mathrm{z}}$ axis, with a /d/-spacing of 1.440 nm, slightly
smaller than that in the edge-on orientation. Together with the
(\(\bar{1}22\)) peak located at the $q_{\mathrm{z}}$ axis, we point
out the emergence of the “face-on” phase in the NWs. The predominant
face-on orientation in the n-type NWs facilitates electron transport
perpendicular to the substrate, through the intermolecular $\pi-\pi$
interactions. The substrate-induced orientation transition also
results in the angle-dependent scattering of the Davydov multiplets
that alters the Raman characteristics (details see Supplementary
information ). Figure [[ref:fig:main-2]](c) presents both the scanning
electron micrograph (SEM) and Raman map for the intensity ratio of the
peak at 1380 cm^{-1} to that at 1315 cm^{-1}, I(1380)/I(1315), on the
F16CuPc film deposited on a sheet of SiO2-supported graphene with a
break. The NW region, with a higher I(1380)/I(1315) ratio, is clearly
identified.

It is straightforward to assume the existence superhydrophobicity at
the NW-liquid interface, as enabled by both the fluorine-rich nature
of F_{16}CuPc, and the Cassie-Baxter wetting phenomenon on the high
aspect-ratio NWs. We validate our hypothesis by examining the water
wettability on the F_{16}CuPc/Gr and F_{16}CuPc/SiO_{2} surfaces
(Figure [[ref:fig:main-2]](d)), using both sessile droplet and
environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) techniques. The
thin-film F_{16}CuPc surface is found to be hydrophobic with a
equilibrium sessile droplet contact angle of $103.0 \pm 5.4 ^{\circ}$
and ESEM contact angle of $107.0 \pm 3.9 ^{\circ}$, as normally
observed for such non-structured fluorine-rich molecules. On the other
hand, the F_{16}CuPc/Gr NWs surface shows much higher equilibirum
sessile and ESEM contact angles of $152.8 \pm 3.9 ^{\circ}$ and $149.8
\pm 3.4 ^{\circ}$, respectively. The great distinction between the
wettability can be briefly explained by the different between the
Wenzel wetting mode on rough planar surface (F_{16}CuPc/SiO_{2}) and
the Cassie-Baxter wetting mode on high aspect ratio surface
(F_{16}CuPc/Gr). The equilibrium contact angles of the two wetting
modes ($\theta^{*}_{\mathrm{W}}$ and $\theta^{*}_{\mathrm{CB}}$) are
given by cite:Cassie_1944,Wenzel_1936:

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:2}
&\cos \theta^{*}_{\mathrm{W}} =& r_{\mathrm{W}} \cos \theta_{\mathrm{Y}} \\
&\cos \theta^{*}_{\mathrm{CB}} =& r_{\mathrm{CB}} f \cos \theta_{\mathrm{Y}} + f - 1
\end{eqnarray}

 where $r_{\mathrm{W}}$ and $\theta_{\mathrm{CB}}$ are the surface
 roughness in both modes, $\theta_{\mathrm{Y}}$ is the hypothetical
 contact angle on an ideally smooth surface form the Young's equation
 and $f$ is the solid fraction in the Cassie-Baxter model. We assume
 that $r_{\mathrm{W}} \approx r_{\mathrm{CB}}$ due to the
 intrinsically identical chemical nature of the two surfaces. By
 plugging in the contact angles on F_{16}CuPc/SiO_{2} and
 F_{16}CuPc/Gr surfaces, we get that $f=0.093$, which indicates a
 minor liquid-semiconductor contact at the interface. By studying the
 dynamic contact angle on F_{16}CuPc with various thickness, we
 confirm the existence of both modes in the two distinct morphologies
 (details see Supporting Information).
*************** TODO Add more details
*************** END
 The high equilibrium ESEM contact of the F_{16}CuPc/Gr surface
 indicates that condensation is unfavorable between the fluorine-rich
 walls of NWs, which is not always achieved on normal nanostructures
 cite:Sharma_2017.
 
 We next examine the wettability of liquid metals (LM) on the
 F_{16}CuPc NWs. It is noteworthy that the key challenge hindering the
 development of LM-based devices is the undesirable adhesion of LM to
 the device surface, in particular about the eutectic gallium indium
 (EGaIn), in which the formation of gallium oxide layer effectively
 reduces the interfacial tension
 cite:Dickey_2008,Doudrick_2014_oxide. Indeed, mercury sessile
 droplets sitting on F_{16}CuPc/Gr NW and F_{16}CuPc/SiO_{2} surfaces
 shows static contact angles of $147.7 \pm 2.5 ^{\circ}$ and $157.1
 \pm 3.8 ^{\circ}$, respectively ([[ref:fig:main-2]] XXX).

 The increase of contact angle is caused by a smaller solid fraction
 of NWs compared with F_{16}CuPc/SiO2 surfaces, since CB mode is
 expected to be seen on both surfaces at such large contact
 angle. More interesting, we found that the NWs can effectively reduce
 the adhesion of EGaIn. We performed the attach-detach cycle test
 cite:Ilyas_2017_EGaIn_review,Jiang_2017_EGaIn_adhesion using a EGaIn
 droplet suspended on a glass microcapillary onto these surfaces. The
 EGaIn droplet adheres onto the F_{16}CuPc/SiO_{2} surface and
 separates from the microcapillary up detaching, while on the NW
 surface neglible adhesion is observed, with the EGaIn droplet
 constantly sticking to the capillary (Figure [[ref:fig:main-2]] XXX). The
 distinguished adhesion properties are also revealed via the sliding
 angle $\theta_{\mathrm{sl}}^{*}$ (equivalent to the contact angle
 hysteresis on the surface) of EGaIn. The F_{16}CuPc/SiO_{2} surface
 has a relatively large $\theta_{\mathrm{sl}}^{*}$ of $56.1 \pm 13.2
 ^{\circ}$, while the NW surface exhibits a much smaller
 $\theta_{\mathrm{sl}}^{*}$ $14.6 \pm 2.6 ^{\circ}$. The superior
 wetting properties of LM on the superhydrophobic NW surfaces
 indicates that the our concept of interfacial transistor is feasible
 through actuation of LM droplets on superhydrophobic semiconducting
 NWs.


The combination between macroscopic superhydrophobicity at the
semiconductor-liquid interface and the face-on orientation at the
graphene-molecule interface of Gr-F_{16}CuPc nanostructures is a
promising platform for building an interfacial transistor. The
superhydrophobicity ensures free manipulation of droplets (in
particular, LM droplets) at the semiconductor-liquid
interface. Electric current that can be passed from the
semiconductor-liquid interface to graphene through the NWs, due to the
high carrier mobility along the \pi-\pi stacking direction. The close
match between the Fermi energy levels of graphene and face-on
F_{16}CuPc molecules is the key to successful gate-tunable current
modulation at the graphene-semiconductor interface. Finally, by
engineering the substrate-graphene interface, we could fine-tune the
doping states in graphene and optimize the performance of the
interfacial transistor. Based on these multiscale phenomena, we
fabricate a graphene-F_{16}CuPc interfacial transistor. As shown in
Figure [[ref:fig:main-3]](a), the interfacial transistor has a vertical
configuration, with the graphene layer serves as the source terminal,
and the Si layer serves as the gate terminal. We use a LM droplet as
the drain terminal on top of the F_{16}CuPc NWs, which is further
attached to a metal plate. The elasticity of liquid and the
superhydrophobicity of F_{16}CuPc NWs ensures reversible pressure
stimuli that can be coupled with the gate-tunable current
modulation. First we look into the gate tunable current at the
graphene-semiconductor interface. Since the droplet-based interfacial
transistor needs to be operated in air, the adsorption and traps at
the substrate-graphene interface needs to be suppressed. This is
achieved by transferring graphene onto SiO_{2} surface with
octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) self-assembled monolayer (SAM). The
OTS-supported SiO_{2} exhibits gate-tunable sheet resistance up to 10
folds and nearly symmetric response with gate voltage (Supporting
Information Figure S12). The interfacial transistor benefits from the
highly tunable electronic states in the graphene sheet. Figure
[[ref:fig:main-3]](a) shows the drain-source current density
$J_{\mathrm{DS}}$ of a interfacial transistor with 300 nm high
F_{16}CuPc NWs and use mercury droplet, as a function of the gate
voltage $V_{\mathrm{G}}$. At a drain voltage $V_{\mathrm{D}}=1$ V, the
tuning the gate voltage from -100 V to 100 V changes the
$J_{\mathrm{DS}}$ by $3.9 \times 10^{4}$ times, a value that is
competitive with the best state-of-art VFETs
cite:Shih2015Partially,Sun_2017_COF_VFET. We tested multiple
interfacial transistor samples and found that the average on-off ratio
is around $5 \times 10^{3}$ times (inset histogram of Figure
[[ref:fig:main-3]](b)). The $J_{\mathrm{DS}}$ shows similar shape respect
to $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ for higher $V_{\mathrm{D}}$ levels, while the
on-off ratio slightly decreases (Figure [[ref:fig:main-3]](c)), which is a
ubiquitous feature of 2D material-based VFETs as the field effect
transparency becomes less at higher drain-source bias
cite:Tian_2016. At $V_{\mathrm{D}}=5$ V, the F_{16}CuPc NWs can
sustain current density as large as $9\times10^{2}$ $\mathrm{mA}\cdot
\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, which is practical for modulation of power devices
thanks to the high carrier mobility of F_{16}CuPc. Consider the fact
that the areas of the NWs in contact with the LM droplet is only a
small proportion compared with the whole contact area of the
droplet-semiconductor interface, the actual current density in the NWs
can be even higher. We also found that the gate-tunability if unipolar
regarding $V_{\mathrm{D}}$. At positive $V_{\mathrm{D}}$ (reverse
bias), tuning $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ from -100 V to 100 V can modulate
$|J_{\mathrm{DS}}|$ over 3 order of magnitudes, while at negative
$V_{\mathrm{D}}$ (forward bias), changing $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ only
modulates $|J_{\mathrm{DS}}|$ by a factor of ~5 times (Figure
[[ref:fig:main-3]](d)). The highly gate-tunable current and unipolar
response to $V_{\mathrm{D}}$ can be explained by the energy level
alignment at the graphene-semiconductor interface, as shown in Figure
[[ref:fig:main-3]](e). The Fermi level of face-on F_{16}CuPc on graphene
is found around -4.5~-4.7 eV
cite:Mao_2010_F16_level_orien,Ren_2011_F16Gr_Elevel,Zhong_2012_gr_CuPc,
matching the Fermi level of graphene (-4.6 eV), and is greatly
different from that of edge-on F_{16}CuPc
(cite:Mao_2010_F16_level_orien). As a result, at open circuit, the
graphene layer is only slightly p-doped (Supporting Information Figure
S12), which is crucial to the wide range of gate tunability. At
reverse bias, the drain-source current is dominated by the Schottky
barrier height (\(\Phi_{\mathrm{SB}}\)) at the graphene-semiconductor
interface. When $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ is larger than the charge neutral
point (CNP) voltage ($V_{\mathrm{CNP}}$, when the graphene layer has
minimal doping), the the Fermi level of graphene shifts down compared
with its Dirac point, giving rise to an elevated $\Phi_{\mathrm{SB}}$,
which suppresses the $J_{\mathrm{DS}}$. On the other hand, when
$V_{\mathrm{G}} < V_{\mathrm{CNP}}$, $\Phi_{\mathrm{SB}}$ is reduced,
which increases the $J_{\mathrm{DS}}$. At forward bias, the current
density in the NW is dominated by the semiconductor-LM interface
cite:Shih2015Partially. Since the work function of mercury (4.5 eV)
matches with F_{16}CuPc, there is negligible transport barrier at the
semiconductor-LM interface, resulting in a almost constant
$I_{\mathrm{DS}}$ regardless of $V_{\mathrm{G}}$. We further
demonstrate an application concerning the gate-tunability of the
graphene-F_{16}CuPc interfacial transistor, by switching an commercial
LED ([[ref:fig:main-3]](f)). Over 10 cycles of on-off switching cycles by
tuning the $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ from -75 V to 100 V, the total current
through the circuit $I_{\mathrm{tot}}$ can be tuned by 250 folds with
appreciable stability.

The elasticity of liquid enables response to pressure stimuli at the
NW-LM interface, with relatively large displacement compared with
conventional piezoelectric devices. We employ this phenomenon in our
interfacial transistor as an additional interface to external
stimuli. The principle behind the elastic pressure sensing using
droplets is the curvature-induced pressure described by the
Young-Laplace equation:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:3}
\Delta p = \gamma (R_{1}^{-1} + R_{2}^{-1})
\end{equation}
where $\Delta p$ is the stress of droplet at the interface, $R_{1}$
and $R_{2}$ are the principle radii of a droplet, and $\gamma$ is the
surface tension of the liquid. The pressure change when deforming a
droplet on a surface gives rise to the change of $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$
(Figure [[ref:fig:main-4]](a)). The change in $R_{1}$ causes the expansion
of contacting are at the semiconductor-LM interface, and change in
$R_{2}$ enables large displacement. To analyze the degree of droplet
deformation, we introduce the droplet strain as the ratio between
vertical displacement and the original height of the droplet $\sigma =
\Delta H / H_{0}$. The strain can be obtained extracting the change of
droplet height between the parallel plates in the microscope
image. The droplet strain can either be calculated from the fitted
principle radii from experimental images using eq [[ref:eq:3]], or using
an analytical model which considers the liquid contact angle on both
plates (see Supporting Information). The values of experimental and
modeled stress as a function of the droplet strain are close to each
other (Figure [[ref:fig:main-4]](b), top), with a maximum stress of ~125
Pa at vertical strain up 12.5%. The stress also leads to an increase
of source-to-drain current in the interfacial transistor. From the
schematic drawing in Figure [[ref:fig:main-1]](c), the change of current
may be due to the increase of contact radius. To verify this
hypothesis, we calculated the current ratio at certain pressure
compared with the reference point ($\Delta p=0$), using both the
experimental value and the simplified model: $I/I_{0} \propto
(r/r_{0})^{2}$, where $r$ is the contact radius (Figure
[[ref:fig:main-4]](b), bottom). Both methods show the same trend,
indicating the stress-responsive current change is mainly due to the
change of contact radius. We note that the ratio calculated from the
simplified analytical model is slightly smaller than the experimental
value, which may be caused by the non-uniform height of the NWs, and
penetration of LM into the voids between the NWs. We further a finite
element model (FEM) to calculate the droplet stress due to the
strain of the LM droplet. We extracted the boundary of the
droplet from the optical images at different displacements and plug
into the analytical and FEM models (Figure [[ref:fig:main-4]](c)). The
pressure values calculated by both models are close, and the maximum
pressure that can be applied before the mechanical failure of the
F_{16}CuPc NWs is between 100 - 200 Pa. The detection at such low
pressure range is already among the most sensitive approaches, while a
relative large displacement can still be assured, benefited from the
elasticity of LM droplet and superhydrophobicity of F_{16}CuPc
NWs. The pressure response can be further coupled with the gate
control of drain-source current, as shown in Figure
[[ref:fig:main-4]](d). The $I_{\mathrm{DS}}-V_{\mathrm{G}}$ curves are
nearly linear proportional to each other under pressure stimuli,
indicating that the pressure sensing does not interfere with the gate
control, and can serve as an additional dimension of control for the
interface transistor. Finally, we examine the reversibility of the
pressure sensing using elastic LM droplets. We monitored the change of
the drain-source current $I_{\mathrm{DS}}$ as a function of time $t$
during more than 10 cycles of pressing-releasing of the LM droplet
([[ref:fig:main-4]](d)).  At average pressure change of 204.2 $\pm$ 12.3
Pa, the current $I_{\mathrm{DS}}$ can be tuned over 12~14
folds. Moreover the low pressure current is maintained closed to the
initial value $I_{0}$, indicating the superhydrophobic-enabled elastic
pressure sensing is reversible.

We can even add an additional interface to the transistor taking
advantage of the thermal response of the graphene-semiconductor
interface. Since the gate-tunable current modulation is related to the
Schottky barrier height $\Phi_{\mathrm{SB}}$, the current density
flowing through the interface can be described by the thermal emission
equation cite:Sze2006Mosfets:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:4}
J_{\mathrm{DS}} = A^{**} T^{2} \exp(- \frac{e \Phi_{\mathrm{SB}}}{kT}) 
                \left[ \exp(\frac{e V_{\mathrm{D}}}{kT}) - 1\right]
\end{equation}
where $T$ is the temperature, $A**$ is the reduced effective
Richardson constant, $e$ is the unit charge, $k$ is the Boltzmann
constant. At same $V_{\mathrm{D}}$ and $\Phi_{\mathrm{SB}}$, the
$J_{\mathrm{DS}}$ is solely controlled by temperature. Within the
reverse bias regime, where Schottky barrier dominates the current, the
higher Schottky barrier is, the larger one can tune the
$J_{\mathrm{DS}}$ by temperature ([[ref:fig:main-5]](a)). Note that since
the thermal expansion of liquid metal is relatively small, the change
of contact area at different temperature levels can be ignored. As a
result, thermal control of the semiconductor serves as an individual
interface to control the transistor. To validate this point, we tested
the gated-tuned current at different temperature levels ranging from
20 $^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to 100 $^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, as shown in
Figure [[ref:fig:main-5]](b). As expected, the current density increases
with the rise of temperature, while the current on-off tuning is not
affected. To further investigate the influence of temperature on the
current, we measured the gain of current $G(T)$ (defined as the ratio
between $I_{\mathrm{DS}}(T)$ and $I_{\mathrm{DS}}(T=20\ ^{\circ}
\mathrm{C})$) at different $V_{\mathrm{G}}$ levels
([[ref:fig:main-5]](c)). The factor $A^{**}$ and $\exp(e V_{\mathrm{D}} /
kT)$ are eliminated when calculate the current gain, therefore it is
possible fit the curve of $G(T)$ by equation [[ref:eq:4]] to extract the
value of $\Phi_{\mathrm{SB}}$. The fitted $G(T)$ curves by
least-square regression show close resemblance to the experimental
data, proving the thermal emission nature of the temperature-dependent
current gain in our interfacial transistor. We further plot the
extracted $\Phi_{\mathrm{SB}}$ values as a function of
$V_{\mathrm{G}}$ in Figure [[ref:fig:main-5]](d). The Schottky barrier
height reduces from 0.46 V at $V_{\mathrm{G}}=-100$ V to 0.16 V at
$V_{\mathrm{G}} = 100$ V. The tuning range of Schottky barrier height
(0.30 V) is consistent with other reports of graphene-based VFETs

the theoretical value (0.59 V), which is not surprising since it is
widely known that the Fermi level of graphene can be pinned by
surface-bound charge traps.


* Conclusions

In this paper, we introduce a new electronic platform -- the
interfacial transistor as an extension to conventional field effect
transistors, by combining multiscale phenomena at different interfaces
to the semiconductor material. As we demonstration example we show the
design and working principle of a graphene-F_{16}CuPc interfacial
transistor. Nanowires of F_{16}CuPc are formed on graphene surface due
to graphene-assisted template effect, giving rise to macroscopic
superhydrophobicity at the NW-liquid interface. The
superhydrophobicity enables versatile operation of droplets on the NW
interface. Owing to the elasticity of liquid droplets, it is feasible
to introduce pressure sensing capability at the semiconductor-liquid
interface, which further enables detection with large displacement. At
the graphene-semiconductor interface, due to the Fermi level match and
field effect transparency, the drain-source current can be tuned over
a large range by gate voltage modulation in a vertical field effect
transistor. Moreover, an additional interface to the semiconductor is
easily introduced involving the thermal carrier emission at the
graphene-semiconductor junction. All the interfaces to semiconductor
can be operated without interference, which facilitates
multi-dimensional operations of the interfacial transistor. Our
concept of interfacial transistors can be extended to a wide variety
of electronic devices, where multiscale phenomena at the
2D-material-semiconductor interfaces are involved. Stimuli responses
involving interfacial physics such as motion of liquid enabled by
superhydrophobic semiconductor nanostructure, light switching due to
optical transparency of 2D materials and charge transfer with
environmental molecules owing to the long Debye length of organic
semiconductors can all be integrated into single interfacial
transistor, which opens a broad future for next-generation versatile,
multifunctional and inexpensive electronics.

#+CAPTION: The concept of an elastic interfacial transistor. (a) Multiscale phenomena in the interfacial transistor: at the macroscopic scale, the superhydrophobicity is induced by fluorene-rich semiconducting nanowires; the nanowires (NWs) is led by the unique molecular templating on two dimensional electron gas (2DEG); the energy level alignment at the semiconductor-2DEG interface further enables field effect modulation of interfacial electronic properties. (b) Schematic drawing of an interfacial transistor, composed of (i) liquid metal droplet as drain terminal, from which the elasticity can be induced; (ii) semiconducting nanowires which provide electronic transport and superhydrophobicity; (iii) a 2DEG as source terminal, of which the transport phenomana can be tuned by field effect. (c) Mechanism of the elastic sensing using liquid metal droplet. Droplet strain in the vertical direction causes elastic stress of the droplet. The contact radius of the droplet increases, and in turn changes the current. Superhydrophobicity of the semiconducting NWs enables repeatable droplet shape deformation.
