\begin{document} {\bfseries A new force-sensing concept of interfacial
  field-effect transistor (IFET) is proposed}. Ultrasensitive stress
sensing is enabled by deformation of liquid metal droplets on
hydrophobic semiconductor nanowires, with the current density further
modulated by field effect at the semiconductor-graphene
interface. This study demonstrates a versatile platform that bridges
multiple macroscopic interfacial phenomena with nanoelectronic
responses.
